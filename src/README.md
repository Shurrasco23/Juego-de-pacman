# Refactor skeleton for Pac-Man project

This folder contains a suggested modular structure for the project. Files are intentionally skeletons with comments and minimal exports so you can compare safely with the original project.

Overview:
- `main.js` - module entry point
- `engine/` - core engine: `Game`, managers, renderer
- `game/` - game logic: `Map`, `Player`, `Ghost`
- `ui/` - UI helpers (controls, HUD)
- `utils/` - utility modules
